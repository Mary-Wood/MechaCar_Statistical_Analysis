# MechaCar_Statistical_Analysis
This repository will store data that is analyzed in R to compare vehicle performance of the MechaCar against vehicles from other manufacturers. This will be done with a multiple linear regression, summary statistics, t-tests and a written summary to provide interpretation. 

## Linear Regression to Predict MPG

A linear regression was conducted to determine if the mpg could predict the values of the other variables (length, weight, spoiler, clearance, and AWD). 
Length, and clearance provided a non-random about of variance to the mpg values in the data set. 
The slope of the linear model , shows an adjusted R^2 (being used as this model has more than 1 variable) of 0.68. 
In general, this model of MechaCar prototypes not predict mpg, although it is clear that length, and clearance are the most predictive variables. The variables of spoiler, AWD, weight r values are not less than .05 and as such would not be considered statitically predictive of mpg.

## T-Tests on Suspension Coilds

## Study Design: MechaCar vs. Competition
The following hypotheses were defined for this reseach: 

  ### Hypotheses: Null and Alternative
  * The Alternative Hypothesis of this research is that the MechaCar performs better than it's competition. 
  * The Null Hypothesis is that there is no statistical difference between the MechaCar and it's competion. 

The following tests will test the hypothesis: 
The metric to be tested is mentioned. 
The data for the statistical test is described.
